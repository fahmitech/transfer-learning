    <h2>About the Research</h2>
    <p>
        Hi There! My name is Fahmi Rachmat Hidayat. Previously, I’m a top 5 winner in prestigious Poe (from Quora) inaugural hackathon developing innovative systems for natural language search. Currently, I’m on my last semester for taking my computer science degree which means I have to do research for my thesis. I myself took topics on Artificial Intelligence specifics in Transfer Learning.
    </p>

    <h3>Transfer Learning in a Nutshell</h3>
    <p>What does Transfer Learning mean? Picture yourself as an infant learning to balance and then to walk. So, because you have control over your body, walking would include using controlled movements in coordination with experiencing new things which will allow your brain to develop creativity. 

        Now, let’s say you’re trying to ride a bike. There is this recollection of the time you rode a bike and that recalls the experience of working through maintaining balance while walking and that is a much needed advantage. You didn’t begin with nothing, you started with your pre-existing know-how; balance and coordination and applied it to the new activity.
        
        So, transfer learning works in that model which has trained for one task is able to reason and perform a different, but appropriate, task. As the child learns a new skill, he applies all that he has already learned in order to overcome the challenge of acquiring a new skill. A model takes advantage of previously learned features to address new data which increases its efficiency and decreases the amount of time and resources spent on new comprehensive training.
        
        </p>
    
    <h3>Objectives of the Research</h3>
    <p>A widely adopted approach in transfer learning is layer freezing, where specific layers of the pre-trained model are frozen (i.e., weights remain unchanged) during fine-tuning. My aim through this research is to investigate the role of layer freezing strategies in transfer learning for transformer-based models, with a specific focus on generating professional look online profile images. 

        However this research needs your contribution to <em>upload your beautiful LinkedIn photo profile</em>. Your photo will only be used for research purposes.</p>
        <p>
      By uploading your profile photo, you'll be contributing to a project that aims to enhance how AI understands
      and generates high-quality, professional-looking profile images. Your photo will only be used for research purposes
      and will never be shared publicly or used commercially.
